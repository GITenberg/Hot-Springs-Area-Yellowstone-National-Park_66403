<p class="tb"><i><b>WELCOME</b> to the Mammoth Hot Spring Terraces,
one of Yellowstone&rsquo;s fascinating natural features! There
are several ways to enjoy the terraces&mdash;hike the boardwalks
or drive the Upper Terrace Loop road, for example.
You may wish to drive to the Upper Terrace Loop,
drop off members of your party, let them hike down the
boardwalk and pick them up at the lower parking area.
The maps in this pamphlet will help you decide how you
might best enjoy the terraces.</i></p>
<p><i>The Mammoth Terraces and Hot Springs were officially
discovered by a U.S. Geological Survey party led by Dr.
Ferdinand Hayden in 1871. However, some local knowledge
of the Hot Spring Terraces and their activity had existed
previous to that time.</i></p>
<p><i>The Mammoth Hot Springs have interested people since
the establishment of Yellowstone National Park, not only
for their striking beauty but also their changeability. These
remarkable springs are noted for their rapid deposition,
unpredictable shifts, and random rejuvenation. Here the
active forces of geology often make measurable changes
from one day to the next, and it is possible that significant
changes have occurred since this booklet was printed.</i></p>
<h3 id="c1"><i>INGREDIENTS FOR HOT SPRINGS ACTIVITY</i></h3>
<p>Hot water is the life of the terraces. Without it terrace
growth ceases; the formations weather gray and black,
and begin to crumble. Typically the many hot springs
gush forth at random, flow a short way, then disappear
into a crack or fissure farther down slope.</p>
<p>In searching around the Mammoth area old dormant terrace
mounds can be found in several places. Although a
frequent shifting seems to take place, the records over the
past several years indicate that the total flow of water has
remained fairly constant at some 500 gallons per minute.</p>
<p>Ground water is the source of the outflow at Mammoth
Hot Springs. It is mostly seepage fed by rain and snow
falling high on the slopes of Terrace Mountain and areas
as far south as Norris Geyser Basin. This cold ground
water is heated before it emerges to the surface by rising
heat from the magma chamber which once fueled the
violent volcanos of Yellowstone&rsquo;s past. See the diagram
on the reverse of this leaflet. The water temperature in
these springs reaches the vicinity of 170 F (73 C.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>Yet still another ingredient is needed for growth of the terraces&mdash;that
is, a basic building material. The raw material
here is calcium carbonate. It is abundant beneath Terrace
Mountain as thick layers of sedimentary limestone.
Related layers of limestone are visible as outcrops on the
face of Mt. Everts across the narrow valley to the east.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig1">
<img src="images/p00.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="573" />
<p class="pcap">Different temperature zones
in the water channels paint
ribbons of algal color.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>As the ground water seeps slowly downward into the
limestone it comes in contact with hot gases rising from
the magma chamber which are heavily charged with carbon
dioxide. Some of the carbon dioxide is readily absorbed
to form a carbonic acid solution. Ordinarily water
can only slowly dissolve limestone, but the hot, acidic
solution rapidly dissolves great quantities of it. Saturated
with lime, the carbonated water continues to seep along
the rock layers until it gushes forth as the Mammoth Hot
Springs.</p>
<p>Once exposed to the open air some of the carbon dioxide
escapes from the solution, thus reducing the acidic level.
As this happens, the lime, no longer able to remain in
solution, is deposited as travertine in the shape and form
of a terrace.</p>
<p>Looking at the terraces you can visualize the amount of
limestone excavated. Geologists estimate that the Mammoth
Hot Springs water carries more than two tons of
dissolved limestone to the ground surface each day.</p>
<h3 id="c2"><i>CHANGE ON THE MAMMOTH TERRACE</i></h3>
<p>The Mammoth Terraces are continuously changing. Had
you visited the area in the 1930&rsquo;s, you would have found
Blue Spring, Cleopatra, and Angel Terraces to be the
feature attractions. Today they stand as gray, lifeless
ruins, and newly named springs have succeeded them.
Throughout the 1970&rsquo;s Jupiter and Minerva Springs and
parts of Highland Terrace have flowed freely, building
delicate and colorful terraces. These clear pools, rimmed
by scallops of algae-tinted travertine, have created spectacles
known around the world for their beauty. The
tiered pools form as a result of the peculiar way in which
the carbon dioxide escapes from the cooling water. In
tranquil pools evaporation is slow. Where water is
agitated the gas escapes quickly. At these points travertine
is deposited rapidly. The rim of deposition grows upward
to form a higher dam, which further accents the two
zones. The travertine rim continues to grow until water
pressure bursts the dam. Then the process begins again at
a prominent riffle in the new channel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<h3 id="c3"><i>COLOR IN THE HOT SPRINGS</i></h3>
<p>Travertine is deposited as a white mineral, yet whenever
hot water glistens on its surface the formation is brilliant
with color. The oranges, yellows, greens and browns are
from a great number of tiny living bacteria and algae. Approximately
sixty-five species of thermal algae live in the
waters of Mammoth Hot Springs and reflect varying conditions
of such environmental factors as temperature,
acidity, sunlight and carbon dioxide concentrations.
White and bright yellow thermal bacteria predominate in
the hottest section of the runoff channels near the springs.
Farther along where the water has cooled a bit, the
orange, brown and green algaes are most abundant. Different
combinations of temperature and carbon dioxide
paint mosaics of algal color across the terraces.</p>
<p>Most of the color comes from the group known as the
blue-green algae, which display more colors than their
name suggests. These thermal algae are extremely primitive
and have probably changed little from those growing
in hot springs at the very dawn of life on earth. Amid any
Yellowstone thermal basin on a steamy day it is easy to
imagine a volcanic region on a primitive earth where hot
spring waters bubbled up through colored strands of these
same types of algae and bacteria.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small"><i>MAJOR FEATURES OF THE LOWER TERRACES</i></span></h2>
<h3 id="c5"><i>OPAL TERRACE</i></h3>
<p>Opal Spring flows at the base of Capitol Hill across the
road from Liberty Cap. After years of dormancy, this spring
became active in 1926 and began depositing up to a
foot of travertine per year. In 1947 a tennis court was
removed to allow natural expansion of the terrace. Further
growth threatened the historic home next to Opal.
Designed by Robert C. Reamer and built in 1908, the
house is an example of Prairie Style architecture. Among
Reamer&rsquo;s other designs are the Old Faithful Inn and the
Roosevelt Arch. Sandbags and an earthen wall today
protect the house. It is the mission of the National Park
Service to protect both historical and natural resources,
which come in conflict at Opal Terrace. Should the spring
be restrained or the historic house removed?</p>
<h3 id="c6"><i>LIBERTY CAP</i></h3>
<p>This feature marks the north end of the Mammoth Hot
Springs. It was named in 1871 by the Hayden Survey
party because of its marked resemblance to the caps worn
by colonial patriots during the Revolutionary War. It
stands today as an extinct hot spring cone. Its outer surface
has been cool and dry for many years and supports a
plant community much different from that found at the
active hot springs. Near the top are patches of orange
lichen which are the pioneers at work breaking the rock
into soil, paving the way for other plants to follow at some
future time. PLEASE STAY ON THE TRAIL as weathering
has loosened rock fragments which may fall at any
time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<h3 id="c7"><i>MINERVA SPRING</i></h3>
<p>Minerva Spring is centrally located within the lower terrace
group and is easily accessible by trail from the various
parking areas. This spring is a favorite not only because of
its wide range of bright colors, but also for its ornate
travertine formations. Since the 1890&rsquo;s when the first
records were kept on the activity of the Mammoth Hot
Springs, Minerva has gone through a series of active and
inactive periods. For several years in the early 1900&rsquo;s it
was completely dry, but by 1951 it was again reported
that &ldquo;Minerva is very active and certainly it is the most
beautiful spring.&rdquo; During the 1970&rsquo;s spring activity has increased
in some of the other features regenerating algae
mats which now rival those found at Minerva.</p>
<h3 id="c8"><i>JUPITER SPRING</i></h3>
<p>Jupiter Spring is situated just south of Minerva. It was
named in the 1880&rsquo;s because of its imposing and towering
formation. Jupiter was a Roman god of the elements: the
thunderbolt was his sign and the rainbow his messenger. If
you listen quietly you may hear the hot water thundering
down the terraces of this feature. The rainbow of algae
covering its terraces is obvious.</p>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small"><i>AUTO TOUR OF THE UPPER TERRACE</i></span></h2>
<p>The entrance to the Mammoth Terrace Drive is one and
one-half miles south of the Mammoth Visitor Center on
the road to Norris. This scenic auto tour winds for one
and one-half miles among several active thermal springs
and has convenient parking pull-outs along the route
where you can stop and become better acquainted with
the features. The drive is a one-way loop road and due to
several sharp turns it is necessary to exclude towing units,
buses and motor homes in excess of 25 feet in length.
Remember that thin crust and very hot water make caution
especially important when you are near thermal
features.</p>

<h3 id="c10"><i>LOWER TERRACE OVERLOOK</i></h3>
<p>This viewpoint offers an excellent overview of the springs
and pools of the Lower Terraces. The large blue pool
ahead and to the right is Canary Spring. The pools visible
to the left are the New Blue Springs complex. The names
of these features suggest colors which are inconsistent
with what we see today. The color of both features has
changed from when they were originally named.
Changes in environmental conditions may account for
this: perhaps a change in water temperature.</p>
<p>The trail to the left goes around New Blue Spring and on
down over the terraces to Minerva Spring. Near that point
the trail branches to the right to Jupiter Spring and past
Minerva itself, or left to Liberty Cap. Both routes lead to
parking areas along the lower road.</p>
<p>Beyond the terraces the red-roofed buildings on the right
are those of historic Fort Yellowstone, built and occupied
by the U.S. Cavalry during their tour of duty here from
1886 to 1918.</p>
<p>The ecological community in this section of the upper terraces
is worth noting. The high content of decayed travertine
produces a porous soil which dries out quickly. Consequently,
vegetation is sparse and is limited to those
species which are tolerant of such conditions. Several
variations may be seen in the plant communities at other
points along the tour road. What environmental conditions
can you detect that might be influencing these differences?</p>
<h3 id="c11"><i>NEW HIGHLAND SPRING</i></h3>
<p>Activity began at New Highland Spring in 1952. The continuous
heavy flow of mineral laden water has caused a
very rapid development of this beautiful terrace. Prior to
that time a luxuriant growth of trees, shrubs and flowers
covered this hillside. The tree skeletons being engulfed by
travertine stand as monuments to the former conditions.</p>
<p>To the right of New Highland still stands a portion of
dense vegetative cover growing on a north facing slope.
Most noticeable upon close inspection is the amount of
undergrowth, which includes a heavy growth of mosses.
What soil and moisture conditions are reflected here?
Why would this area be so different?</p>
<h3 id="c12"><i>ORANGE MOUND SPRING</i></h3>
<p>The bright orange of this formation is a clue to the temperature
of its water. Also, the rate of flow and the rate of
deposition are very slow. It could follow then that since
we have no record of this spring ever being very active,
this small mound could be considerably older than those
that are much larger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<h3 id="c13"><i>BATH LAKE</i></h3>
<p>Just ahead of you is a short but very steep hill. At the bottom
of this hill on the right is Bath Lake, named by some
of the local residents in the 1880&rsquo;s. Being a quiet pool,
deposition of travertine is at a slow rate and the water remains
highly mineralized with limestone. According to the
old records Bath Lake was entirely dry in 1926 and remained
that way until the 1959 earthquake. Although the
name of this feature derives from the soldiers&rsquo; habit of
swimming in it, we now know that this activity damages
the bacteria and algae which are part of what the park exists
to preserve. Bathing in thermal features is also unsafe
and unlawful.</p>
<h3 id="c14"><i>WHITE ELEPHANT BACK TERRACE</i></h3>
<p>This long white ridge is unusual for a hot spring terrace
and adds a touch of fantasy to the area. Someone has
said that it resembles a string of circus elephants marching
over the Mammoth Terraces. Take the time to view it
from different angles to see what you think!</p>
<p>The final section of the Upper Terrace Drive goes through
a wooded area. Mule deer are frequently seen here,
especially during the late afternoon and evening.</p>
<p>Forest vegetation along this section is dense even though
it a south-facing slope. The thermal features in this vicinity
are old and have been inactive for many years. This has
allowed for a more complete decomposition of the travertine
and an accumulation of a heavier, richer soil. Its
moisture-holding properties far exceed those of the soil
found at the Lower Terrace Overlook.</p>
<h3 id="c15"><i>ANGEL TERRACE</i></h3>
<p>At the bottom of the hill on the left are the ruins of Angel
Terrace. Visitors during the 1920&rsquo;s and 30&rsquo;s saw it as a
beautiful algae-tinted feature. Today it is beginning to
crumble and young pioneer plants are taking root in the
thin soil over its surface.</p>
<p>Alteration and change are constantly occurring in the
thermal basins and add to the mystery of this fascinating
land. They bring not destruction and loss, but rather new
birth and gain. Who knows what interesting ornate new
features may develop by next year, or in five years. You
are encouraged to return again and again to enjoy this
ever-changing scene.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
